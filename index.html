        <b>Thread Navigator</b> is a project by <a href="https://neural-reckoning.org/dan_goodman.html">Dan Goodman</a> to experiment with different ways to display deeply nested social media threads. At the moment, it is working with Bluesky and only has a linear, hierarchical thread view. I'll be adding Mastodon support and different views over time. Check out the project and help out at <a href="https://github.com/thesamovar/thread-navigator">https://github.com/thesamovar/thread-navigator</a>. You can create a bookmarklet in your browser with the following code as the URL so that when you're navigating on Bluesky and click the bookmarklet, you'll be taken to a thread view of the current page:<br/><code>javascript:(() => {const url = encodeURIComponent(window.location.href); window.open(`https://thesamovar.github.io/thread-navigator/index.html?url=${url}`, '_blank');})()</code>
